1.Create an account on crypto-wallet  Metamask.


2.Creating an ERC20 token involves a Solidity contract that implements the ERC20 token standard. This contract will define the token's properties, such as the total supply, symbol, name, decimals, and token balances for each address.


3.Now this can either be done by manually writing the code or by using existing platforms like 20Lab, Kaleido etc. I used this to create my ERC-20 token. Set out your preferences and voila, your contract is compiled and deployed.


4.To publish your token, a gas fee is charged. Be sure to mine the said currency beforehand(I mined GoerliETH testnet from here).


5.Now check your Token on https://etherscan.io/
